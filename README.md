## 🧭 About

I'm Khansa — a final-year Software Engineering student from Pakistan, with 7+ months of hands-on DevOps & InfoSec experience (SOC2, CI/CD, Vulnerability Mgmt), and an obsession with secure infrastructure, AI, and real-world impact.

While my CGPA doesn’t tell the full story, my work, leadership, and curiosity do.

I’ve revived clubs, led 1,000+ students, collaborated with global devs, and spoken on international stages — all while shipping secure systems and learning daily.
